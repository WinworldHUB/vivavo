## Code Organisation

**Folder Structure**

*src*
- assets
- components
- data
- services
- views

**Assets Folder**
Comprises of all assets used in the HTML ([index.html](/public/index.html))

**Components Folder**
Comprises of all custom develop components to be used in the project.
**N.B.: *React Components***
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

**Data Folder**
Comprises of JSON mock-up data that was being used before API integration. Also has configuration file that is used for configuring pages

**Services Folder**
Comprises of APP Level utilities and hooks.

**N.B.: *React Hooks***
Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

**Views Folders**
Comprises of UI pages which will relate to various Virtual Office Modules. Pages are organized in sub-folders based on modules within this folder.

## Available Scripts
*In the project directory, you can run:*

## npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
